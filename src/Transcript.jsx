00:01:01.719 for India in the Paris Olympics we
00:01:03.559 bagged another medal India is now
00:01:05.319 looking to set a historic Benchmark at
00:01:07.360 this Edition and amongst this hype Nita
00:01:10.000 Amari supported India's interest in
00:01:11.640 hosting the Summer Olympics in 2036 now
00:01:14.360 this seems like an insane move right we
00:01:16.320 could host one of the biggest events in
00:01:17.799 the world millions of tourists will
00:01:19.600 flock to India India would become the
00:01:21.840 epicenter of global attention tourism
00:01:24.040 would increase we would make millions of
00:01:26.079 dollars and the entire world would
00:01:28.040 witness the grand Indian growth story
00:01:29.920 story right well I hate to break it to
00:01:32.439 you but all of this is utter nonsense
00:01:34.920 because you know what the Olympics is
00:01:37.320 actually an economic disaster for the
00:01:39.240 host country you don't believe me look
00:01:41.520 at this while beijing's 2008 Summer
00:01:43.680 Olympics cost over $42 billion it
00:01:46.119 generated only $3.6 billion in Revenue
00:01:49.040 while Vancouver's Winter Games in 2010
00:01:51.320 cost $7.6 billion it generated only $2.8
00:01:55.119 billion and London's Summer Games in
00:01:57.520 2012 cost $18 billion but generated only
00:02:01.399 $5.2 billion in Revenue so with each
00:02:04.439 passing Olympics the host country bleeds
00:02:06.960 with billions of dollars in losses so
00:02:08.919 the question is how can such a grand
00:02:10.598 world event become a loss making Venture
00:02:12.959 why is there such a false hype around
00:02:14.640 the economics of Olympics and most
00:02:16.200 importantly why is hosting the Olympics

00:03:42.080 description CH let's start by
00:03:44.480 understanding why do countries host the
00:03:46.159 Olympics in the first place this is a
00:03:48.159 story that starts with a Curious Case of
00:03:50.159 1984 when Los Angeles hosted the Summer
00:03:53.000 Olympics and by the end of this event
00:03:55.200 they ended up with a hefty profit of
00:03:56.799 $232 million that's worth more than $700
00:04:00.480 million today so when Los Angeles made
00:04:03.000 such a hefty profit it became an
00:04:04.920 aspiration for all other countries
00:04:06.760 across the world and now even if the
00:04:09.519 Olympics directly don't result into a
00:04:11.640 profit they say that the economic
00:04:13.760 benefits that Olympics brings to a
00:04:15.760 particular country that is unparalleled
00:04:18.279 and many politicians often say that it
00:04:20.358 is a catalyst to push a particular City
00:04:22.759 5 years into the future for example in
00:04:25.199 2016 the Olympics in Brazil impacted
00:04:27.800 around 2,200 micro small businesses who
00:04:31.000 received 390 million brazan real in
00:04:33.520 contracts eventually 18,000 new jobs
00:04:36.400 were created similarly when Barcelona
00:04:38.880 hosted the games in 1992 its General
00:04:41.400 unemployment rate fell from 18.4% to
00:04:44.759 99.6% between 1986 and 1992 and even the
00:04:49.120 Paris Olympics of 2024 is estimated to
00:04:51.680 create 181,000 jobs the second reason
00:04:55.280 why countries host the Olympics is
00:04:56.800 branding and propaganda and you know
00:04:58.479 this already from our Qatar case study
00:05:00.120 from 2022 but if you forgot the case
00:05:02.680 study or if you don't know about this
00:05:04.000 case study here's a very very simple
00:05:05.720 explanation of the same here's how
00:05:07.360 Hitler used the Olympics as a genius
00:05:09.560 marketing strategy the city of Berlin
00:05:11.880 was awarded the auspicious task of
00:05:14.199 hosting the 1936 summer Olympic Games it
00:05:17.759 would be the first time a host nation
00:05:19.680 would project its political ideology and
00:05:21.919 power onto the world the German athletes
00:05:24.560 Were Soldiers on the propaganda battle
00:05:26.560 unit
00:05:30.800 Berlin is cleaned up anti-jewish signs
00:05:34.120 were removed everything was done to
00:05:36.080 create the impression that this was a
00:05:38.120 hospital climate no one could have
00:05:40.440 predicted was that these Gaines would be
00:05:42.319 used as a tool for some of the slickest
00:05:44.680 propaganda by one of the most tyrannical
00:05:47.039 regimes the world has ever seen people
00:05:50.160 in 1923 Germany had witnessed a
00:05:52.400 horrendous condition of hyperinflation
00:05:54.400 and it was so bad that in 1922 160
00:05:57.520 German marks was equivalent to $1
00:06:00.360 but by November 1923 which is just one
00:06:02.759 year later the currency of Germany
00:06:04.960 depreciated to such an extent that to
00:06:06.960 buy one US you needed 4.2 trillion
00:06:10.639 German marks so obviously because of
00:06:13.080 hyperinflation there were no jobs people
00:06:15.319 were dying out of hunger and it was a
00:06:17.160 catastrophe that Germany had never seen
00:06:19.199 before so the entire world saw Germany
00:06:22.120 as a poor country with no bread but in
00:06:25.400 the next 10 years Germany had become a
00:06:27.680 far richer country and they wanted to
00:06:29.319 show the world that they were no longer
00:06:31.240 a poor country so Germany won the bid
00:06:33.800 for hosting the 1936 Olympics in 1931
00:06:37.039 but here's where Germany was in for a
00:06:39.240 surprise in 1933 Hitler became the
00:06:42.360 dictator of Germany on the 30th of
00:06:44.520 January
00:06:45.639 1933 Hitler became German
00:06:50.880 Chancellor the German people see him as
00:06:53.800 a savior Hitler propagated his racial
00:06:56.840 ideology early on he insisted that that
00:06:59.800 one group was to blame for the nation's
00:07:01.800 post-war
00:07:02.919 misfortunes the Jews directing it
00:07:05.560 against anyone he saw as alien to the
00:07:08.080 German nation and the entire world had
00:07:10.520 heard rumors about racism against the
00:07:12.720 Jews but this is when the propaganda
00:07:15.120 minister of Hitler saw the Olympics as
00:07:17.360 the best opportunity to show three
00:07:19.039 things to the world number one they
00:07:21.080 wanted to show what new Germany under
00:07:22.960 Hitler looked like number two they
00:07:24.960 wanted to prove that dictatorship of
00:07:27.360 Hitler was far better than the Dem
00:07:29.479 democracies in Europe and lastly they
00:07:31.800 wanted to market the idea of Arian race
00:07:34.319 to the world and here's the most ironic
00:07:36.120 Act of all Hitler actually released
00:07:38.400 hundreds of pigeons in the ceremony as a
00:07:40.879 message of peace to the world and guess
00:07:43.639 what the 1936 Olympics was the first
00:07:46.879 Olympic event to be broadcasted on
00:07:48.720 television so it was by far the most
00:07:51.120 powerful tool of propaganda on top of
00:07:53.280 that during the games the signs of
00:07:54.919 banning Jews from public places had
00:07:56.440 disappeared and the Germans were ordered
00:07:58.560 to be very nice to everyone especially
00:08:00.599 the African-Americans why because back
00:08:03.199 then there was ongoing racism against
00:08:04.879 the black athletes in the US and Europe
00:08:07.159 but when these athletes came to Germany
00:08:09.440 they were delighted to see the kind of
00:08:11.360 respect and Hospitality that they got so
00:08:13.560 when they went back home the stories of
00:08:15.639 equality and Hospitality of Germany
00:08:17.319 traveled all across the world in fact
00:08:19.639 one of these athletes even quoted to the
00:08:21.159 press that Germany treated him so well
00:08:23.680 that he didn't have to sit at the back
00:08:25.479 of the bus similarly many reporters
00:08:28.280 wrote incredible things about Germany in
00:08:30.360 all newspapers across the world and just
00:08:32.559 like Hitler wanted people actually saw
00:08:34.559 how much Germany had developed in just
00:08:36.039 13 years in spite of witnessing the
00:08:38.120 worst economic crisis in its history so
00:08:41.000 this gave Hitler both a voice on the
00:08:43.120 global stage and earned him even more
00:08:45.160 respect among the German public this is
00:08:47.480 how ladies and gentlemen Sports washing
00:08:49.760 works this is the first method of
00:08:52.000 branding but guys not all hosts are evil
00:08:55.160 okay they do it sometimes for real
00:08:56.880 branding for example South Korea head
00:08:59.399 held the seal Olympics in 1988 to show
00:09:01.880 off its economic miracle for those who
00:09:03.959 don't know from 1975 to 1988 the South
00:09:07.480 Korean economy grew at such an
00:09:09.120 incredible Pace that it grew from just
00:09:11.240 $21 billion in 1975 to almost 200
00:09:15.200 billion doar in 1988 that's a staggering
00:09:18.120 growth of 10x in just 12 years on top of
00:09:22.320 that South Korean companies like Samsung
00:09:24.200 and Hundai were leading the tech
00:09:25.800 revolution in the world and during the
00:09:27.480 same time North Korea was struggling
00:09:30.040 because of dictatorship so to
00:09:31.760 demonstrate to the world that South
00:09:33.399 Korea was a free capitalist Nation open
00:09:35.640 for investment they hosted the Olympics
00:09:37.720 of 1988 so you know what happened after
00:09:40.480 that 1988 was the first year that the
00:09:43.519 foreign direct investment in country
00:09:45.000 crossed a billion dollars and since then
00:09:47.240 it kept on increasing and increased up
00:09:49.399 to $1.5 billion in 2000 this is how
00:09:53.440 Olympics acted as a catalyst of
00:09:55.680 investment and growth for South Korea
00:09:58.000 similarly then 196 before Tokyo Olympics
00:10:00.279 in Japan was meant to symbolize the rise
00:10:02.160 of Japan From the Ashes of World War II
00:10:04.079 in 1972 the Munich Olympics in Germany
00:10:06.680 was a part of an effort to promote the
00:10:08.560 idea of New West Germany that was free
00:10:10.640 from the impacts of World War II and
00:10:12.440 China used it to sports wash its image
00:10:14.480 of uer Muslim persecution this is the
00:10:17.200 second reason why Nations host the
00:10:18.920 Olympics in spite of losses which is
00:10:20.959 branding and finally Olympics serve as a
00:10:24.200 catalyst of Tourism and just to tell you
00:10:26.279 how powerful the Olympics is here's an
00:10:28.200 example of Barcelona
00:10:29.920 people in 1990 Barcelona was the 13th
00:10:32.880 most popular destination in Europe but
00:10:34.959 in 1992 Summer Olympics the broadcasters
00:10:37.639 highlighted all the non-sports venues in
00:10:39.839 Barcelona this was a big big marketing
00:10:42.240 boost for Barcelona and even after the
00:10:44.160 Olympics got over they kept on marketing
00:10:46.440 Barcelona to the world eventually by
00:10:48.920 2010 Barcelona became the fifth most
00:10:51.880 popular destination on the continent so
00:10:53.959 this sounds amazing right great PR
00:10:56.160 massive Investments and an insane
00:10:57.920 tourism boost so so it's a great idea to
00:11:00.279 host the Olympics right but even then
00:11:02.000 why do economists say that Olympics are
00:11:03.519 bad for the economy and why is Olympics
00:11:05.839 hosting bad for India well as it turns
00:11:08.240 out the Olympics being profitable and
00:11:10.480 boosting the economy is the story of the
00:11:12.959 past and in the recent times the cost of
00:11:15.920 hosting the Olympics have shot up so
00:11:17.839 much that like I said before beijing's
00:11:20.240 2008 Summer Olympics cost over $42
00:11:22.279 billion it generated only $3.6 billion
00:11:25.440 in Revenue while Vancouver's Winter
00:11:27.399 Games in 2010 cost 7 .6 billion it
00:11:30.800 generated only $2.8 billion and London's
00:11:34.079 Summer Games in 2012 cost $18 billion
00:11:37.519 but generated only $5.2 billion in
00:11:40.560 revenue and today Olympics are so bad
00:11:42.760 for the economy that they could
00:11:44.440 practically cause an economic crisis in
00:11:46.480 a country so the question over here is
00:11:48.680 how did Olympics become such a terrible
00:11:50.680 waste of money well the first reason is
00:11:53.040 the rise of terrorism as it turns out
00:11:55.600 just like countries want publicity even
00:11:57.920 terrorists want to use olyp Olympics to
00:11:59.720 establish their power and it started
00:12:01.639 with a shocking incident in the 1972
00:12:04.160 Olympics in Munich they were supposed to
00:12:06.480 be the happy games but the attack on the
00:12:09.519 Israeli team turned the Olympic Games
00:12:11.800 into a tragic chapter of German history
00:12:14.240 eight men inct suits hopped the fence at
00:12:16.760 Munich's Olympic Village in the end 11
00:12:19.320 members of the Israeli team were killed
00:12:21.320 along with one German police officer and
00:12:23.519 five of the Palestinian gunmen and after
00:12:25.920 the 9911 attacks the security cost
00:12:27.680 increased so much that while the
00:12:29.519 security for Sydney's games in 2000 cost
00:12:31.600 $250 Million Just 4 years later in
00:12:34.480 Athens security expenditure shot up to
00:12:36.920 1.5 billion that's a six times increase
00:12:40.440 in cost in Just 4 years secondly from
00:12:44.240 the time of bidding to the time of
00:12:45.560 hosting the entire economic landscape of
00:12:47.920 the host country changes in simple words
00:12:50.040 let's look at India pick any decade in
00:12:52.320 the Indian history and you will see that
00:12:54.320 the Indian economic landscape is
00:12:56.240 completely different for every single
00:12:58.279 decade in the 1970s the entire world
00:13:01.519 experienced two oil shocks because of
00:13:03.480 which inflation in India shot up to
00:13:06.480 28.6% as a result we had an economic
00:13:09.079 crisis in India in the 1980s we faced a
00:13:12.199 balance of payment crisis where we
00:13:14.040 almost went bankrupt in the 1990s we
00:13:17.240 liberalized our economy and India was
00:13:19.240 all about growth and development from
00:13:21.480 2000 to 2010 we saw the 2008 recession
00:13:24.880 and from 2010 to 2020 we saw another
00:13:28.160 recession along with with covid and now
00:13:30.839 from 2020 to 2030 we already have the
00:13:33.560 Russia Ukraine war and the Israel
00:13:35.199 Palestine War eventually because of
00:13:37.399 these wars the cost of Commodities shoot
00:13:39.560 up now imagine if we decided to host the
00:13:41.480 Olympics in 2008 or 2018 or even 2021 in
00:13:46.279 2008 we would have held the Olympics
00:13:48.079 amidst the worst economic crisis in
00:13:49.680 modern history in 2018 we would have
00:13:52.199 held the Olympics while India was still
00:13:53.639 recovering from the demonetization shock
00:13:55.680 and in 2021 we would have held the games
00:13:58.120 when Millions were ding due to the covid
00:14:00.079 wave and during this time that is just
00:14:02.399 after covid if I tell you that your
00:14:04.959 hard-earned money is being spent on a
00:14:07.079 fancy opening ceremony how would you
00:14:09.000 feel imagine that you are starving but
00:14:11.320 India is happily facing a loss of 10,000
00:14:13.480 crores in the Olympics would you feel
00:14:15.360 good about the country during that time
00:14:17.440 no right so long story short because of
00:14:19.959 the unpredictable nature of geopolitics
00:14:22.440 consistently the cost of Olympics has
00:14:24.759 shot up and if you look at this chart
00:14:26.880 for Russia the cost overrun was 28 9%
00:14:29.880 for Brazil it was 352 for Tokyo it was
00:14:33.480 128% and for Beijing it was 149% so even
00:14:38.160 if countries take inflation into account
00:14:40.399 it is very difficult to forecast the
00:14:42.079 nature of geopolitics the third reason
00:14:44.320 why the Olympics is an economic disaster
00:14:46.199 is because there's a huge gap between
00:14:47.880 the projected jobs and the actual jobs
00:14:50.040 created in the economy of a country and
00:14:52.040 this is what the pr teams of 2036
00:14:53.920 government will tell you K bab jobs will
00:14:56.040 be created economy will be boosted and
00:14:58.199 India's image will be transcended in
00:15:00.240 front of the world but I hate to break
00:15:02.560 it to you that all of this is just
00:15:04.480 economic delusion look at this table in
00:15:07.000 Los Angeles yes 5,000 jobs were created
00:15:09.720 in Atlanta yes between 3,000 to 42,000
00:15:13.000 jobs were created but after that in 1972
00:15:16.040 although incomes increased there was no
00:15:18.199 impact on employment in 1996 there was
00:15:21.040 increase in hotel prices but no impact
00:15:23.360 on taxable sales in 2002 sales of
00:15:26.519 restaurant shot up by $70 million but
00:15:28.959 merchandise sales were down by $167
00:15:31.440 million in 2000 Summer Games household
00:15:34.519 consumption actually decreased by 2
00:15:36.959 billion doar so do you see this as time
00:15:40.199 is passing the impact of Olympics is
00:15:42.680 fading away so the Olympics are like the
00:15:45.160 Nokia of the sports event Once a Legend
00:15:47.399 but now a loss making Venture thirdly
00:15:50.079 the economists and politicians often say
00:15:51.720 that Olympics and World Cup type events
00:15:53.880 will help us build sports facilities for
00:15:55.680 the generations to come well
00:15:57.759 unfortunately this is also impractical
00:16:00.639 because look at this the stadiums cost
00:16:03.040 about $1.3 billion to build and used to
00:16:05.639 take $67 million a year to maintain the
00:16:08.480 new stadiums in Rio suffered the same
00:16:10.360 fate after the 2016 Summer Olympics 12
00:16:12.959 of the original 27 venues have not been
00:16:15.079 used once since the games and are
00:16:16.759 crumbling from structural problems
00:16:18.519 suffering from frequent vandalism and
00:16:20.600 now home to infestations of rodents and
00:16:22.600 insects and lastly the politicians often
00:16:24.639 argue that because of the deadline of
00:16:26.759 the Olympics infrastructure growth is
00:16:29.000 accelerated because of which the city is
00:16:31.240 actually pushed 5 years into the future
00:16:33.800 for this I just have one argument is
00:16:35.920 Olympics really decreasing your cost no
00:16:38.240 is it giving you more money no it is
00:16:40.519 only giving you a deadline so my
00:16:42.720 question is will we speed up our
00:16:44.000 construction only when there is an
00:16:45.240 international deadline hanging over aead
00:16:47.600 that is Impractical and if you're saying
00:16:49.720 that we are incompetent and just because
00:16:52.040 we are incompetent with our deadlines is
00:16:54.279 it right to host an event that is going
00:16:56.279 to drain billions of dollars of
00:16:57.759 taxpayers money think about it so the
00:17:00.399 morel of the story is that in the race
00:17:02.399 of winning medals and the Olympic hype
00:17:05.039 the wave of nationalism should not
00:17:06.919 result into an economic disaster in
00:17:09.720 2036 and lastly even if all these
00:17:12.000 arguments are put down there is one
00:17:13.760 little hope to increase tourism and
00:17:15.799 getting FDI like South Korea because of
00:17:18.799 Olympics and for that there's just one
00:17:21.119 thing to be said people marketing is the
00:17:23.760 smallest element that gets you foreign
00:17:25.679 direct investment because even if
00:17:27.240 someone wants to invest 1,000 CR in
00:17:29.080 India today if we don't fix basic things
00:17:31.600 like import Duty land acquisition and
00:17:33.600 highways no company would come to India
00:17:36.320 so one big event can give you a push but
00:17:38.960 in the long term is the fundamentals
00:17:40.960 that will help you not Marketing in the
00:17:43.000 business world as they say great
00:17:44.640 marketing doesn't build a strong
00:17:46.120 business great products do and when it
00:17:48.280 comes to tourism the best way to
00:17:50.160 increase tourism is soft power in this
00:17:52.640 case just like South Korea used K-pop to
00:17:54.960 change the perception of South Korea if
00:17:57.080 China and Russia spent over 40 million
00:17:59.120 dollars into making Hollywood movies it
00:18:01.679 would change the perception of China and
00:18:03.440 Russia in front of the world so this is
00:18:05.840 a far better far sustainable and far
00:18:08.400 more profitable venture to pursue than
00:18:10.400 the Olympics so while the Olympics is a
00:18:12.320 good booster there are much better
00:18:14.240 economical and Powerful boosters
00:18:15.679 available in the handbook of soft power
00:18:17.840 building so we need to take inspiration
00:18:20.000 from South Korea rather than taking
00:18:21.880 inspiration from China these are the
00:18:24.120 reasons why ladies and gentlemen
00:18:25.600 Olympics would be an economic disaster
00:18:27.480 for India and we must get have Basics
00:18:29.320 right with the ease of doing business
00:18:31.080 build soft PA through International
00:18:32.559 appeal of movies and most importantly we
00:18:34.840 should not bet on the geopolitics of the
00:18:37.039 world because it takes only one madman
00:18:39.840 to shake the world over this is the
00:18:42.360 economic Outlook of the Olympics so what
00:18:44.520 is the morel of the story the Olympics
00:18:46.400 used to be a great investment but it no
00:18:48.120 longer is inflation can be predicted but
00:18:50.280 geopolitics cannot be predicted General
00:18:52.360 infrastructure building must happen
00:18:53.799 irrespective of Olympics or FIFA and
00:18:55.880 lastly everything that the Olympics can
00:18:58.320 bring with a billion dollars in loss can
00:19:00.480 be acquired with a profit of a billion
00:19:02.200 dollars and with 100x better output
00:19:04.960 examples ease of doing business is far
00:19:07.039 more effective than marketing and soft
00:19:08.960 power building over the decade is far
00:19:11.120 more effective than one grand event this
00:19:14.240 is a dark side of the economics of
00:19:16.039 Olympics that I wanted to present to you
00:19:17.520 and I just hope you learn something
